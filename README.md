# 2-bit-Vedic-Multiplier
A 2-bit Vedic multiplier uses the "Urdhva Tiryakbhyam" (Vertically and Crosswise) algorithm from ancient Indian Vedic mathematics to multiply two 2-bit binary numbers. This efficient method breaks the multiplication process into smaller steps, producing a 4-bit output. It simplifies hardware design and speeds up computations in digital circuits.
